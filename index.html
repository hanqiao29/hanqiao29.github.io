                Hi there! Iâ€™m Han. I am a PhD student at University of Toronto Faculty of Information, advised by Christoph Becker.
                I am currently working in the intersection of human-computer interaction and urban planning.
    
            </p>
            <p>
                I graduated from Wellesley College,
                studying math and media arts and sciences (cs + design). Both math and design
                are subjects that always keep me in awe and provide me unique ways
                to connect with other people. I then obtained my MSc in urban planning at University of Pennsylvania. <br>
    
                <br>
                In 2021, I worked with Lydia Chilton and Vivian Liu at the Columbia University Computational Design Lab. This
                has been an incredible experience for me to delve a little bit deeper into human creativity and human-AI interaction.

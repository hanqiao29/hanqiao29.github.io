        Hi there! Iâ€™m Han. I am a PhD student at University of Toronto Faculty of Information, advised by Christoph Becker.
        I am currently working in the intersection of human-computer interaction and urban planning.

    </p>
    <p>
        I graduated from Wellesley College,
        studying math and media arts and sciences (cs + design). Both math and design
        are subjects that always keep me in awe and provide me unique ways
        to connect with other people. I then obtained my MSc in urban planning at University of Pennsylvania. <br>

        <br>
        In 2021, I worked with Lydia Chilton and Vivian Liu at the Columbia University Computational Design Lab. This
        has been an incredible experience for me to delve a little bit deeper into human creativity and human-AI interaction.

        <br>
        My current research focuses on understanding how digital tools/data help (or not help) communities' sense making and
        decision making in urban planning process.
    </p>

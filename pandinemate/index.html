		<h3 id="dine"><b>Overview</b></h3>
		<p class="projectdes">PanDineMate is a web application / data visualization 
            dashboard that provides people assistance in making more informed decisions 
            on where to eat amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.
        </p>

		
		<h3 id="dine">My Role</h3>
		<p class="projectdes">
			Throughout the whole process, my team of 3 urban planners 
            worked closely together to bring this application to life. 
            I was mainly responsible for building the frontend and backend features 
            that communicate between user and the Yelp database through Yelp API so that 
            relative information can be displayed to users. I also served as the project 
            manager of the team to breakdown the challenging parts into manageable pieces 
            so different people can work together on different parts to meet our expectations.

		<h3 id="dine">Key Features</h3>
		<p class="projectdes">
			<b>Location preference selection  </b>
            <br>
            Restaurants are first displayed by distance to users location. 
            Users can either allow the web app to access their current location or manually 
            change their location using the location selection button.

		<p class="projectdes">
			<b>Restaurant preference selection </b>
            <br>
			Users can refine the restaurant recommendation display by using 
            the “Search Option.” Users can enter keywords (business name or cuisine name), 
            set price range, set rating standard and select the option for whether restaurants 
            provide delivery options.

		<p class="projectdes">
			<b>Restaurant information display</b><br>
            When a user clicks on a restaurant on the map, the name of the restaurant 
            will pop up and the corresponding information will be displayed on the left. 
            Information displayed is provided by Yelp developer database, including 
            restaurant picture, location, phone number, rating and price range.

        <p class="projectdes">
			<b>Covid information display</b><br>
            Covid information is displayed using a Leaflet map and a data dashboard. 
            The background map is color coded based on the number of COVID-19 cases in the 
            last two weeks -- the darker the area, the more positive COVID-19 cases are found. 
            The COVID-19 information is updated in real time with the Philadelphia API Explorer. 
            <br>
            <br>
            When a user clicks on a restaurant, COVID-19 vaccination information of 
            the zip code area is displayed on the top right using a pie chart.
            <br>
            <br>
            Finally, a COVID-19 risk assessment of the area is displayed on the left bottom 
            of the sidebar. We coded three levels from low risk to medium risk and to high risk 
            based on vaccination rate and number of new COVID-19 cases. For high risk areas, 
            we suggested ordering take out and delivery. We also recommend that everyone wears a 
            mask and brings a hand sanitizer when eating out.

			<h3  id="dine">Reflection and Takeaways</h3>
			
            Through working together with my team to create this web application,
             I was able to not only apply technical skills I learned in class but also
             gain experience in coding in a team. I learned the importance of both
             execution and strategic planning, including planning out features, break down
             challenging problems into manageable pieces 
             and delegate tasks so the team can complete the project in a short amount of time.
            <br>
            <br>
            Upon reflection, I realized that presenting COVID-19 risk by using zip code boarders might
            not be the best way for if a restaurant is located on the fringe of an area, it is hard to 
            associate the restaurant with data in only one area. In the future,
            I would love to conduct more user research and improve features in an iterative process.

            Please shoot me an email if you want to download PanDineMate. 
            We would love to share our code for building better products together.

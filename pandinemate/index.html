		<h3 id="dine"><b>Overview</b></h3>
		<p class="projectdes">PanDineMate is a web application / data visualization 
            dashboard that provides people assistance in making more informed decisions 
            on where to eat amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.
        </p>

		
		<h3 id="dine">My Role</h3>
		<p class="projectdes">
			Throughout the whole process, my team of 3 urban planners 
            worked closely together to bring this application to live. 
            I was mainly responsible for building the frontend and backend features 
            that communicate between user and the Yelp database through Yelp API so that 
            relative information can be displayed to users. I also served as the project 
            manager of the team to breakdown the challenging parts into manageable pieces 
            so different people can work together on different parts to meet our expectations.

		<h3 id="dine">Key Features</h3>
		<p class="projectdes">
			<b>Location preference selection  </b>
            <br>
            Restaurants are first displayed by distance to users location. 
            Users can either allow the web app to access their current location or manually 
            change their location using the location selection button.

		<p class="projectdes">
			<b>Restaurant preference selection </b>
            <br>
			Users can refine the restaurant recommendation display by using 
            the “Search Option.” Users can enter keywords (business name or cuisine name), 
            set price range, set rating standard and select the option for whether restaurants 
            provide delivery options.

		<p class="projectdes">
			<b>Restaurant information display</b><br>
            When a user clicks on a restaurant on the map, the name of the restaurant 
            will pop up and the corresponding information will be displayed on the left. 
            Information displayed is provided by Yelp developer database, including 
            restaurant picture, location, phone number, rating and price range.

        <p class="projectdes">
			<b>Covid information display</b><br>
            Covid information is displayed using a Leaflet map and a data dashboard. 
            The background map is color coded based on the number of COVID-19 cases in the 
            last two weeks -- the darker the area, the more positive COVID-19 cases are found. 
            The COVID-19 information is updated in real time with the Philadelphia API Explorer. 
            <br>
            <br>
            When a user clicks on a restaurant, COVID-19 vaccination information of 
            the zip code area is displayed on the top right using a pie chart.
            <br>
            <br>
            Finally, a COVID-19 risk assessment of the area is displayed on the left bottom 
            of the sidebar. We coded three levels from low risk to medium risk and to high risk 
            based on vaccination rate and number of new COVID-19 cases. For high risk areas, 
            we suggested ordering take out and delivery. We also recommend that everyone wears a 
            mask and brings a hand sanitizer when eating out.

			<h3  id="dine">Reflection and Takeaways</h3>
			I see this project both as a success and as a failure. 
            It is a success because my team worked together to create this web application,
             which allowed us to not only apply technical skills we learned in class but 
             gained experience in coding in a team. We learned how to plan out all the features 
             and delegate tasks so that we can complete the project in a short amount of time.
            <br>
            <br>
            However, it is also a failure because after the project is completed, 
            I realized that this is a product that few people would use. Although concerned 
            about the pandemic, people would be unlikely to choose a restaurant based on COVID-19 
            cases in a zip code neighborhood. Through this project, I learned the importance of user 
            research. Any product built without users in mind will never make the impact that 
            the creators hope for.
            <br>
            <br>
            Please shoot me an email if you want to download PanDineMate. 
            We would love to share our code for building better products together.

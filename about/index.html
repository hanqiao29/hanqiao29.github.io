			Hi there! Iâ€™m Han. I am currently taking a gap year working as a research assistant in the field of human-computer interaction.

		</p>
		<p>
			I graduated from Wellesley College, MA,
			studying Mathematics and Media Arts and Sciences (CS + Design). Both math and design
			are subjects that always keep me in awe and provide me unique ways
			to connect with other people.<br>
			<br>
			Starting from graduate school at UPenn, I have been using data to help me 
			answer questions about cities. Although statistics is a
			rational way of finding answers, it is limited. Often, we need to
			understand the stories behind the numbers. Revealing these stories
			requires understanding of a bigger picture through talking to people and listening to their stories. 
			Therefore, I found myself again and again
			fascinated by how other people tell their stories and I hope to travel to different places, listening to
			as many stories, and hope that I can become a better storyteller in the
			future.
		</p>
		<p>
			<!-- I play the violin and the viola. I doodle. I ice skate.
			I enjoy thinking through random questions. Iâ€™m always excited to
			meet people and listen to their stories. ðŸ’¡ -->
		</p>

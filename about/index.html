			Hi there! Iâ€™m Han. I am currently finishing up my last year studying
			City Planning/Transportation at University of Pennsylvania.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am originally from Beijing, and graduated from Wellesley College,
			MA, majoring in Math and Media Arts and Sciences.
			Two big parts of my passion are math/data analysis and art/design.
			I enjoy the mathematical and logical reasonings behind data analysis,
			and at the same time, I enjoy building emotional connection with
			other people through art and design. I am studying city
			planning where I am able to combine my two interests to create products
			that can bring positive impact to the world. In the future,
			I hope to work in the transportation industry to better
			understand peopleâ€™s traveling needs and create better designs
			for a more enjoyable, sustainable and equitable future mobility.
		</p>
		<p>
			I play the violin and the viola. I doodle. I ice skate.
            I enjoy thinking through random questions. Iâ€™m always
			excited to meet people for music jamming and sharing brilliant
			ideas with each other. ðŸ’¡

			Hi there! I’m Han. I am currently finishing up my last year studying
			City Planning/Transportation at University of Pennsylvania.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am originally from Beijing, and graduated from Wellesley College,
			MA, with a double major in Mathematics and Media Arts and Sciences.
			Two big parts of my passion are math/data analysis and art/design.
			I enjoy the mathematical and logical reasonings behind data analysis,
			and at the same time, I enjoy the freedom of expressing myself and
			connecting with other people through design. I am studying city
			planning where I can combine my two interests to create products
			that bring positive impact to the world. I hope to work in the
			autonomous vehicle industry to better understand people’s traveling
			needs and create better designs for a more enjoyable, sustainable
			and equitable future mobility.
		</p>
		<p>
			I play the violin and the viola. I doodle. I ice skate.
            I enjoy thinking through random questions. I’m always
			excited to meet people for music jamming and sharing our brilliant
			thoughts together!
		</p>

		<h3 id="future"><b>Overview</b></h3>
		<p class="projectdes">In the design thinking class I took at UPenn, 
            we were given an open ended task to envision the future of connection. 
            After brainstorming different types of connections, our team decided to 
            focus on dating, which stemmed from our frustration with the current dating 
            app experiences and eagerness for finding a better way to be connected with other people.
        </p>

        <i>üåü Key Problem: How might we foster meaningful communication and relationship through online dating?
        </i>

		
		<h3 id="future">My Role</h3>
		<p class="projectdes">
			I was mainly responsible for desining and conducting interviews in the background research phase as well as
            prototyping phase. Throughout the whole process, my team worked closely together to brainstorm,
            disucss, design and present our ideas to other people from the research phase,
            to ideation phase and to prototyping phase.

		<h3 id="future">Project Timeline</h3>
		<p class="projectdes">
			<b>Phase 1: Research  </b><span class="skill">üîß Academic Journal | Interview | News</span>
            <br>

            Our team conducted literature reviews on dating and relationships as well as 
            articles on current dating apps. I conducted 6 semi-structured interviews 
            with people who have different dating app experience -- from people who have 
            never used dating apps to those who are currently using dating apps to those who met 
            their partner through dating apps and to those who used dating apps 
            but stopped using them.
        </p>

        <p class="projectdes">
            <i>üåü Phase 1 Key Results</i>
            <br>
            We found people have the need to connect with others and form deep relationships.
            More people are using dating apps to meet people outside of their social network.
            The reasons people are concerned about using dating apps are: 
            1. a lack of trust in strangers, 2. time consuming, 
            3. connections through dating apps are transient and shallow.
        </p>

			<b>Phase 2: Brainstorm and Define </b><span class="skill">üîß Crazy 8 | Impact-Feasibility Matrix | Storyboard</span>
            <br>
			In the brainstorming phase, 
            each of the team members brainstormed ideas using Crazy Eight 
            and three final ideas tackling different phases of dating was selected 
            for further evaluation:

            <img src="image/future-crazy8.png" alt="Brainstorm diagram" id="ec"/>
            We decided to focus on VR dating for this project 
            because it will have a bigger impact on the online dating 
            experince and at the same time it is a more feasible idea given
            the current technological development. 
            <img src="image/future-feasibility-matrix.png" alt="feasibility matrix" id="ec"/>
            Then my teammate Yuran visualized our idea using a storyboard and her amazing graphic skills.

            <i>üåü Phase 2 Key Results</i>
            <br>
            After evaluating different ideas, we decided to focus on VR dating 
            based on impact and feasibility analysis. A storyboard 
            is created to help us ideate detailed features of the experience and convey our envisioned ideas.

			<b>Phase 3: Prototyping</b><br>
			Based on the three key features of the VR dating experience we identified 
            (1. An experience that requires attention and focus, 
            2. Dating in a safe and comfortable environment 
            3. Availability of system provided activities and games) 
            and our goal of understanding how people feel about meeting up with a 
            stranger through such a system, I designed a prototype using Zoom as the medium of 
            meet-ups. To prototype the games and activities provided on the VR platform, 
            I gathered games that participants can play together online, including Scribble, 
            Boggle and New York Times 36 questions to fall in love etc.

        <p class="projectdes"> 
            I conducted three prototype testing sessions with six participants. 
            During the sessions, I muted my video and audio, acted as the voice 
            assistance of the system and observed the interaction of the participants. 
            After the session, I conducted interviews separately with each of 
            the participants to gather their feedback on the prototype and their experience.

            <br>
            In the prototyping phase, I gathered feedback for the VR dating 
            experience and ways to improve the prototype for future iterations.

			<h3  id="future">Impact and Takeaways</h3>
			Two participants from the prototype user research continued chatting over Zoom 
            every week after the user testing session. They shared with me that 
            the prototyping session allowed them to meet ‚Äúa great friend who understands 
            so much about their life after the first meet up session.‚Äù
            <br>
            <br>
            How people connect with each other has always been a fascinating topic for me. 
            Making meaningful connections with people coming from different life stories gives me 
            joy. Through this project, I am so grateful to work with three amazing 
            teammates and our instructor to leverage design thinking tools to explore a topic 
            that I am passionate about.
            <br>
            <br>
            Although we envisioned a more immersive future dating experience using VR and games, 
            I see the potential of using video chats as an alternative to remove the 
            technical barriers for users who do not have access to VR
            and still provide a medium for fostering meaningful 
            conversations.

            Even though this project ended in the prototyping phase, please shoot me an 
            email if you are interested in working together to create an experience that 
            fosters meaningful connection. üíú

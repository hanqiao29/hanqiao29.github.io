I was having an enjoyable dinner with a friend, when he suddenly frowned at the clock.

"What happened?"

"The second hand is going too fast today..."

"..."

So we ended up watching a few movies about time, the subject that is most mysterious
for human beings.

"About Time" 2013. If we could live our lives multiple times, would you change anything?

"Arrival" 2016. Human thinks linearly, whereas aliens don't.

"5 Centimeters per Second" 2007. What defines distance between people? space, time, or neither?

"Life is Fruity" 2016. How people in their nineties perceive time.

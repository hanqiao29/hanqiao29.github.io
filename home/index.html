			Hi there! Iâ€™m Han. I am a PhD student at University of Toronto Faculty of Information, advised by Christoph Becker.
			I am currently working in the intersection of human-computer interaction and urban planning.

		</p>
		<p>
			I graduated from Wellesley College,
			studying math and media arts and sciences (cs + design). Both math and design
			are subjects that always keep me in awe and provide me unique ways
			to connect with other people. I then obtained my MSc in urban planning at University of Pennsylvania. <br>

			<br>
			In 2021, I worked with Lydia Chilton and Vivian Liu at the Columbia University Computational Design Lab. This
			has been an incredible experience for me to delve a little bit deeper into human creativity and human-AI interaction.

			<br>
			My current research focuses on understanding how digital tools/data help (or not help) communities' sense making and
			decision making in urban planning process.

I"œ<p>I was having an enjoyable dinner with a friend, when he suddenly frowned at the clock.</p>

<p>â€œWhat happened?â€</p>

<p>â€œThe second hand is going too fast todayâ€¦â€</p>

<p>â€œâ€¦â€</p>

<p>We ended up watching a few movies about time, the subject that is most mysterious
for human beings.</p>

<p>â€œAbout Timeâ€ 2013. If we could live our lives multiple times, would you change anything?</p>

<p>â€œArrivalâ€ 2016. Human think linearly, whereas aliens donâ€™t.</p>

<p>â€œ5 Centimeters per Secondâ€ 2007. What defines distance between people? space, time, or neither?</p>

<p>â€œLife is Fruityâ€ 2016. How people in their nineties perceive time.</p>
